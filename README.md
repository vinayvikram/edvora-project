# This project had been given by Edvora to test my skills in frontend development.
## In this project, I have built a product catalogue which can be filtered on the basis of Brand name, State and City.
## The list of products is fetched in real time from a dummy database for project purpose only.
## I developed this using NEXTJS framework.
### Thanks edvora for giving me this opportunity.
